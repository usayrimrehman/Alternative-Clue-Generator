# Alternative-Clue-Generator
Implementation of an artificially intelligent program (HUKAB), which takes the NY Times 5x5 crossword puzzle, and generates alternate clues for the puzzle. The program made use of a Selenium code for web scraping, and parsing to extract the puzzle, an solution on the NY Times website by converting the puzzle's HTML code into a JSON file. The program then searched for alternative clues to the solutions on Wordnet, Merriam Webster by making use of the Natural Language Toolkit. The Tkinter library was also employed by the program to design a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display the puzzle, along with its solution, and clues, both the original, and the alternative.
